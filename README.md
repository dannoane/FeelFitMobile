# BikeAppMobile

The goal is to create an app that tracks the user's route when biking/running.
It should show the user his location on a map, give him statistics like time,
distance, speed (current, min, max, avg), altitude, temeprature, etc. Let him
pause the workout at any time, save it, tag other friends or enable live tracking.
When starting a workout the user can choose to start a new route, select from 
prevoiusly completed ones or from other routes in his area. Also, the user can
comment and review other routes, add photos and talk to other users.
